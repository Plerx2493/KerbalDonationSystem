# KerbalDonationSystem
KerbalDonationSystem short KDS is a project divided into 2 parts. A mod for KerbalSpaceProgram (KSP) and a website built with .Net Blazor to configure all settings and handle events coming from Twitch

# Disclaimer
The idea for this project comes from [Woeller](https://www.twitch.tv/woeller) and the first, now deprecated, version was built by [Vali](https://github.com/ValentinBischof). This project is a ground up new implementation.
